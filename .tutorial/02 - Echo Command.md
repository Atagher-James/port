# Echo Command

In the first part of this tutorial, you will learn the ```echo``` command, which functions very similar to the ```print``` command in python.

write this code in your editor and run it. What happens?

```bash
echo Hello World!
```
Nothing too special, just a line of text. Try this code. What goes wrong?

```bash
Echo Hello World!
```

It will give you an error. Make sure not to capitalize the `echo` command. Try this code next.

```bash
echo 'Hello World!'
```

It works just as intended. Single quotations work just as good as no quotations. Now try this code.

```bash
echo 'This is line 1!'
echo 'This is line 2!'
```
It writes multiple lines of code. You can also do it in one line using a semicolon like this.

```bash
echo Hello world!; echo Hello Antarctica!
```

### Your Challenge

Write a line of code promising yourself that you will leave having learned something from this. Then, in the same line of code, write `something random`. Literally copy that and write it.
