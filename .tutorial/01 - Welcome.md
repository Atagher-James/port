# Welcome!

**This is my tutorial for the #2022TutorialJam on Replit. I have chosen Bash for my tutorial.**

### What is Bash?

Bash is a name of the unix shell, which was also distributed as the shell for the GNU operating system and as the default shell on most Linux distros. Nearly all examples in this tutorial can be a part of a shell script or executed directly in the shell.

### Why Bash

Bash, at least on Replit, is not a language that many people learn because there is little to no use with it in a workspace for creation of a game or a webpage, but it is important to learn because it is used in a shell quite often.

### Information

There will be XX parts of the tutorial. I am keeping the parts short because I loke the instant gratification of moving on to the next part, so the parts are short and explaied simply, but there is so much information to take in. Go to the next page to begin the tutorial.
